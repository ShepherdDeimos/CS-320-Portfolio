These files demonstrate my work in software testing, automation, and quality assurance. They showcase my ability to create unit tests, interpret software requirements, and apply appropriate testing strategies.

## Reflection

**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**  
I ensure my code is functional by writing and running unit tests that cover different scenarios, including edge cases and expected failures. I also practice good coding habits like validating inputs, using error handling, and keeping dependencies updated to minimize vulnerabilities and security risks.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**  
I interpret user needs by carefully analyzing the project requirements and breaking them down into specific, actionable tasks. I prioritize building features that align with the user's goals and frequently test to make sure the program meets the intended needs.

**How do I approach designing software?**  
When designing software, I first focus on understanding the main problem the program needs to solve. I break down the solution into smaller components, define how each component will interact, and organize my code to be modular and maintainable. I also plan for future testing and improvements early in the process.
